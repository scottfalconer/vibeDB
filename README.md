# vibeDB

vibeDB is a minimalist, text-based memory system designed to naturally store and recall important events. It emphasizes simplicity, portability, and human-friendly structure by using six optional fields: `who`, `what`, `when`, `where`, `how`, and `thing`. These fields capture factual context clearly, deferring interpretation for later use or analysis.
